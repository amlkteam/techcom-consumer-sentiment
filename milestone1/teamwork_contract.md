# Distribution of work

Set up clear guidelines and work expectations at the beginning of the group project. Assign roles and responsibilities so that each person will be making an equal contribution. Speak directly, but respectfully to the person who is not completing their work.

# Frequency of meetings

We will meet twice a week. Once after our Tuesday lab to devise a plan for solving the assignment and the second time during our Thursday lab.

# Having meeting agenda and minutes

No, but during each meeting we will jot down a summary of the discussions in our own notebooks and confirm with every group member about the decisions made to ensure a clear direction.

# Style of working

We will discuss on Slack and during our meetings and agree on the division of work.

# Submitting a written summaries of contributions of each member

No, for our project we will not be submitting written summaries of our contributions because we have already divided the project into equal parts for each person to complete.
    
# Expectations regarding quality of work

Each person is expected to complete the assigned work before the deadline. The quality of the code should be good with relevant document. Each code chunk should include a comment so that everyone in the group understands what the code is doing. Early communication is key to make sure everyone is focused on common goals. Keep goals realistic and understand that our actions affect others in the group. Make a timeline so that the group can stay on an agreed plan for getting the project done. 

# Availability of team members

We are available Monday to Sunday and if we are not available on any day we will inform the other members.

# Project manager

Serena will be the project manager.

# Code of conduct

The division of work has to be agreed by everyone in the group.
