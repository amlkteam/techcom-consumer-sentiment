# How will work be distributed in a fair and equitable way?

Set up clear guidelines and work expectations at the beginning of the group project. Assign roles and responsibilities so that each person will be making an equal contribution. Speak directly, but respectfully to the person who is not completing their work

# How often will group meetings occur (here is a nice article on meetings)?

We will meet twice a week. Once after our Tuesday lab to devise a plan for solving the assignment and the second time during our Thursday lab.

# Will you have meeting agendas and minutes?

We will discuss our Thursday lab agenda during our meeting after Tuesday lab. 

# What will be the style of working?

We will discuss on Slack and during our meetings and agree on the division of work.

# Will you use daily "stand-ups", or submit a written summaries of your contributions, or something else?

No for our project we will not be submitting written summaries of our contributions because we have already divided the project into equal parts for each person to complete.
    
# What is the quality of work each team member expects from themselves and each other?

Each person is expected to complete the assigned work before the deadline. The quality of the code should be good with relevant document. Each code chunk should include a comment so that everyone in the group understands what the code is doing. Early communication is key to make sure everyone is focused on common goals. Keep goals realistic and understand that our actions affect others in the group. Make a timeline so that the group can stay on an agreed plan for getting the project done. 

# When are team members not available (e.g., evenings and Sundays because of family obligations).

We are available Monday to Sunday and if we are not available on any day we will inform the other members.

# Will you have someone who acts as the project manager (i.e. keeps things on track) for the entire project, or each milestone, or be entirely democratic throughout the project?

Serena will be the project manager.

# Is there any behaviour you wish to highlight as being expected or unacceptable (i.e., what is the code of conduct for the group?)

The division of work has to be agreed by everyone in the group.
