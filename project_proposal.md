# COLX523 - A Sentiment Analysis of Big Tech on Twitter and Weibo

The following is the project proposal for Group 5: Serena, Amy, and Varun

## Introduction
Our project will be an analysis of a corpus of tweets / blogs about five Big Tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft) and how they are perceived on social media. Specifically, we will be looking at Tweets on Twitter in both French and English, and Weibo blog posts in Chinese. The goal of this project is to understand how consumers perceive these companies (for example, if they are excited, disillusioned, or distrustful) and whether there are noticeable differences across languages and countries. We are interested in this topic as it is very relevant both in current affairs and to our program.

## The Data
The English and French data will come from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/home) and the Chinese data will come from [Weibo](https://www.weibo.com/us). These are generally short social media posts written in an informal tone. We will be using hashtags and the search function on Twitter and Weibo in order to find our tweets, and we will only look at tweets (not retweets) from individual users, rather than companies or media outlets. This ensures that our corpus focuses on the sentiment of the consumers, rather than on companies or media outlets who want to promote their products or points of view. We believe that because of the scope of this search (both in topics and in languages), there will be enough data to create a corpus of approximately one million words. 

## The Corpus
The corpus will be collected as a CSV file. Each person will be in charge of collecting one part of the corpus in one language from one source: Varun will collect English data from twitter, Serena will collect French data from twitter, and Amy will collect Chinese data from Weibo. Along with the text of the tweet itself, we will collect the username of the person that posted their tweet, a description of that user as collected from their profile, the language that the tweet is in (one of English, French, or Chinese), and the location metadata of their tweet. 

As for annotations, we are considering noting the sentiment / polarity of the tweet (positive vs negative), the relationship between the user and the company that they are talking about (eg, are they a consumer? an employee? a critic?), and the purpose of their tweet/post (are they complaining about something? are they contributing to public discourse? are they giving their opinion on a new feature / bug?). These annotations will allow us to better understand the data in order to answer our research questions.
