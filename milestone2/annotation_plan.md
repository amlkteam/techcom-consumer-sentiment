Annotation Plan

- Kinds of annotation:
We will be doing labeling of (1) positive/negative sentiment on the target tech company mentioned in the tweet/Weibo microblog, and (2) if the emotion expressed is relevant to the tech company.

- Tools for annotation creation:

For the English and French tweets collected, the annotators will receive a copy of csv file that contains tweets for annotation and will label the sentiment and relevancy in a single new column, which allows 6 input labels only(Very Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Very Negative, Irrelevant).

For the Chinese Weibo microblogs, Amazon Mechanical Turk's template on sentiment analysis task will be utilised to get annotations from outside annotators.

- Annotators:

For the French tweets, Serena's friends Molly Chen and Joanna Chung will do the annotations. They studied in the same French major with Serena and are both fluent in French.

For the English tweets, Varun's parents will do the annotations. They are fluent in English.

For the Chinese weibo microblogs, external annotators from the crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk will be recruited with a paid reward for each annotation task.

- Rough expectation for amount of annotations to collect in a week

French tweets: about 200 annotations per hour, approximately 800 annotations in total, as it's expected annotators would spend a total of 4-5 hours in the week.

English tweets: about 100-200 annotations per hour with a total of 4-5 hours effort from each annotators.

Chinese weibo posts: 100 annotations for each company, approximately 400 annotations in total, as Chinese texts are longer in general, and so it may take some more time to gauge sentiments. This smaller number of annotation also takes into account the $50 budget available.

- Quality check of annotations:

All annotators will be given an annotation guideline with detailed examples on the 6 labels of annotation as training.

On Mechanical Turk, there will be worker restriction that only naive Chinese speaker can do the annotation tasks.
